# CSS

css briefly:

-controls things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages or
parts of a page, and how to add
background images.
 -There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

-controls where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen.
