## HTML5

it is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.


## DOCTYPES 

tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
 The  id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
The  <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
Escape characters are used to include special  X characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
